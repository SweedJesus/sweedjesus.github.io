# One-dimensional maps

A *dynamical system* consists of a set of possible states, together with a rule
that determines the present state in terms of past states.
<!-- -->
If the present state can be determined uniquely---without randomness---the rule
is *deterministic*.
<!-- -->
If the present state relies on a element of randomness we do not have a
dynamical system and instead a *random*, or *stochastic*, *process*.
<!-- -->
Two types of dynamical systems will be emphasized: *discrete-time* and
*continuous-time*, the rule of the latter involving set of differential
equations.
