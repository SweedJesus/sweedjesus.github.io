*Factor and determine any and all roots of the quadratic polynomial:*
\\[ 2x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0 \\]

Because the discriminant... \\[(4) - 4(2)(-2) = 20\\] Is positive the polynomial
has two real roots and the completely factored form should be
\\(a(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)\\)

1.  Factor 2 from left \\[ x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 \\]

2.  Add 1 to both sides \\[ x^2 + 2x = 1 \\]

3.  Complete the square \\[ ((2)/2)^2 = 1,\\quad x^2 + 2x + (1) = 1 + (1) \\]

4.  Factor left \\[ (x + 1)^2 = 2 \\]

5.  Solve for x \\[ x = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\]
