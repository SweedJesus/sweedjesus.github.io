*Factor and determine any and all roots of the quadratic polynomial:*
\\[ 2x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0 \\]

Discriminant:
\\[(4) - 4(2)(-2) = 20\\]

Because the discriminant is positive the polynomial has two real roots and the
completely factored form should be that of \ref{factored-quadratic:b}

1.  Factor 2 from left
\\[ x^2 + 2x - 1 = 0 \\]

2.  Add 1 to both sides
\\[ x^2 + 2x = 1 \\]

3.  Complete the square
\\[ ((2)/2)^2 = (1) \\]
\\[ x^2 + 2x + (1) = 1 + (1) \\]

4.  Factor left (perfect square)
\\[ (x + 1)^2 = 2 \\]

5.  Solve for x
\\[ x = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{2} \\]
