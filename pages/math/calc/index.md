These are my notes from my times in calculus classes  and in review . Most of
this content I wrote as classes went on, so depth and rigor might by lacking
and there are probably plenty of errors. I've also put together some review
sets and example problems that are probably most easily found by just
navigating the repository at
[pages/math/calc](https://github.com/sweedjesus/sweedjesus.github.io/pages/math/calc);
I did them either straight in LaTeX or in my quiz-generator DSL (so LaTeX).
