## Jekyll

([Homepage](https://jekyllrb.com))
A simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or
organization sites written in Ruby. Probably obvious already but this site uses
Jekyll. These are some of the resources listed on the Jekyll site about Jekyll:

- [CloudCannon---Jekyll Tips](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/):
  Didn't know what CloudCannon was before checking the resources, but it's just
a WYSIWYG Jekyll hosting service (think CMS). Don't think much about it but
their learning area is good. Some of the page topics: installing Jekyll,
intro to the Liquid templating language, [Jekyll cheatsheet][], etc.

## Content

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):
  The opposite of a markup language like HTML, Markdown seeks to simplify
  content creation and maintenance by being human readable (get it, mark*up* and
  mark*down*).

## CSS

- ~~[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/):
the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework. Uses jQuery and defines all sorts
of good looking and ubiquitous components, especially the Grid system.~~ I just
do everything by hand these days, and/or borrow directly from Bootstrap.

## Javascript

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com):
    Super popular JavaScript library that's basically ubiquitous across the
    internet.
- [AnchorJS](https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/):
    Adds deep anchor links to content.
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/):
    A display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers, and uses LaTeX
    syntax.
