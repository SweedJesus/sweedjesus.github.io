# Static webbases

A static webbase is the simplest type of webbase where there is no database or
programming going on serverside to "serve" content and instead there's just
the content as it is.

## Jekyll

([Homepage](https://jekyllrb.com))
A simple, blog-aware, static base generator for personal, project, or
organization bases written in Ruby. Probably obvious already but this base uses
Jekyll. These are some of the resources listed on the Jekyll base about Jekyll:

- [CloudCannon---Jekyll Tips](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/):
  Didn't know what CloudCannon was before checking the resources, but it's just
a WYSIWYG Jekyll hosting service (think CMS). Don't think much about it but
their learning area is good. Some of the page topics: installing Jekyll,
intro to the Liquid templating language, [Jekyll cheatsheet][], etc.

# Markdown

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):
  The oppobase of a markup language like HTML, Markdown seeks to simplify
  content creation and maintenance by being more human readable.
- [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org):
  The default Markdown engine used by Jekyll.

# CSS

- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/guide):
  A preprocessed, more powerful version of just CSS alone.

- ~~[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/):
  The most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework. Uses jQuery and defines all
  sorts of good looking and ubiquitous components, especially the Grid system.~~
  I just do everything by hand these days, and/or borrow directly from
  Bootstrap.

# Javascript

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com):
    Super popular JavaScript library that's basically ubiquitous across the
    internet.
- [AnchorJS](https://www.bryanbraun.com/anchorjs/):
    Adds deep anchor links to content.
- [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/):
    A display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers, and uses LaTeX
    syntax.
