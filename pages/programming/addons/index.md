AddOns for World of Warcraft will always have a special place in my heart as I
taught myself how to program by writing a few. These days I don't play much WoW,
but when I do I only play on private legacy servers like [Nostalrius][nost]
(RIP) and [Elysium][elysium]. Private servers run older versions of the game, as
you would have played years ago when those versions were considered "live" and
"retail". The demand for these kinds of servers appears to me to be growing.
Nostalrius and Elysium are "Vanilla" servers; that is they run the very first,
original, expansion of the game (specifically for client version 1.12). So here
is a list of some of my AddOns for Vanilla World of Warcraft:

### [sjMacro][sjmacro-repo]

An addon that seeks to provide mouse-over ability casting to vanilla WoW,
something that wasn't added until the expansion after Vanilla. Seeks to be as
small, as minimal as possible, but I did also write functionality for
automatically down-ranking spells. I'll probably want to separate this out to a
dedicated, small, addon in the future.

### [DarkSoulsDeathScreen (DSDS)][dsds-repo]

Written for a request, displays the graphic and plays the sound of the
ubiquitous YOU DIED message from Dark Souls.
