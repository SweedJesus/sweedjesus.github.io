- [Factory Key][01] This should never leave your gamma. On factory it opens two
  additional extracts (Gate 0, Cellars) and allows you to open the locked room in third
  floor offices which has a possible weapon spawn, two coats, loose loot and
  occasional high end ammo. Where this key can be found: Customs 3-Story dorm
  guard station; Customs glass warehouse in the blue locker; Customs glass
  warehouse on the couch next to the dead scav; Customs checkpoint car trunk,
  possibly in jacket therein; in scav backpacks.
- [Key (pumping station)][02] Opens the "closed bunker" near machinery in the
  exit area but only the door nearest extract. There is rarely anything worth
  picking up in here but it can be a good ambush position. This key spawns in
  the locker room on the bench against the wall close to the entrance. 
- [Key (admin)][03] Opens the "closed bunker" near machinery in the exit area.
  There is rarely anything worth picking up in here but it can be a good ambush
  position. This is a random drop now.
