- [Factory Key][01] This should never leave your gamma and opens two additional extracts and allows you to open the locked room in third floor offices. Possible weapon spawn in locked room, two coats, loose loot and occasional high end ammo. This key spawns in the office of 3-Storey in Customs, and the glass warehouse in Customs (in the blue locker or near the dead scav).
- [Key (pumping station)][02] Opens the "closed bunker" near machinery in the exit area but only the door nearest extract. There is rarely anything worth picking up in here but it can be a good ambush position. This key spawns in the locker room on the bench against the wall close to the entrance. 
- [Key (admin)][03] Opens the "closed bunker" near machinery in the exit area. There is rarely anything worth picking up in here but it can be a good ambush position. This is a random drop now.
