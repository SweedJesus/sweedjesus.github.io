# About Me

I'm a professional student, a programmer, a singer, and a video-game enthusiast.

I love music. I have studdied classical voice, piano, and composition, and I
have an associates degree in music theory. Genres I love are metal (like black
metal, post metal, folk metal), classical (as in all of the eras), electronic
music (trance, electro house, etc.). I also love computer games. Always have
always will.

# About this site

I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll] to build it.

Originally I used the [Minimal][minimal] theme by [GitHub Pages][github-pages],
and then I heavily modified it, but now I use layouts and style-sheets that I've
written from scratch.

I'm also using the JavaScript libraries [AnchorJS][anchorjs],
[MathJax][mathjax], and [VexFlow][vexflow] throughout the content.
