# About Me

I'm a professional student, programmer, singer, and video-game enthusiast.

I love music. I have studdied classical voice, piano, and composition, and I
have an associates degree in music theory. Genres I love are metal (like black
metal, post metal, folk metal), classical (as in all of the eras), electronic
music (trance, electro house, etc.).

I also love computer games. Always have always will. On Steam I'm
[SweedJesus][steam], and on the Vanilla private server [Elysium
(Anathema)][elysium] my main is Miraculin, 60 priest in [Titans of War][tow] (a
guild which has since moved to play on other servers).

# About this site

I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll] to build it.

Originally I used the [Minimal][minimal] theme by [GitHub Pages][github-pages],
but I've heavily modified it.

I'm also using the JavaScript libraries [AnchorJS][anchorjs],
[MathJax][mathjax], and [VexFlow][vexflow] throughout the content.
