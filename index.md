# About Me

I'm a math student, programmer, singer, and game enthusiast.

I love music. I've studdied classical voice, piano, and composition, I have
an associates degree in music theory, and I sing regularly in a few choirs.
A few of the genres I listen to the most are
[metal](pages/music/lists/#metal/),
[post-rock](pages/music/lists/#post-rock/),
Americana,
[electronic](pages/music/lists/#electronic/) and
[classical](pages/music/lists/#classical/).

I also love computer games. Always have always will.
