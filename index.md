# About this site

I'm using [Jekyll][jekyll] to build it.

The base theme is the [Minimal][minimal] theme by [GitHub Pages][github-pages],
with modified layouts, includes and styles.

I'm also using the JavaScript libraries [AnchorJS][anchorjs],
[MathJax][mathjax], and [VexFlow][vexflow] throughout the content.
